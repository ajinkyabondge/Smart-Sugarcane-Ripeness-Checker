# Smart-Sugarcane-Ripeness-Checker
An intelligent Python-based tool that analyzes sugarcane images to instantly determine ripeness using HSV color detection. It provides accurate, non-destructive, and real-time results, classifying canes as Unripe, Partially Ripe, or Fully Ripe through a clean, interactive Tkinter interface â€” bridging tech and agriculture.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
